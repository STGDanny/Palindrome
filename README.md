# Palindrome
Simple C++ program to determine if a string is a palindrome.

# Limitations
Inputs are NOT case-sensitive.

Any newlines in your string will be removed, if that matters.

Checking multiple words IS allowed.

The longest string that can be checked is 20 characters long.
This can be changed by modifying the MAX_STR_SIZE constant in palindrome.h.
For example the longest palindrome string according to some sources is ~74000 characters.
Changing the constant to that value should work, I can't speak to it's potential runtime however.
